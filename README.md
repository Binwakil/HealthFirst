# HealthFirst

The Health First App (Health First Healthcare Delivery System) is an automated, lite and efficient application that would solve the problems associated with the traditional approach of Healthcare delivery from doctors to their respective patients. Through the use of single Android-based Application that would allow patients to choose their doctors, and enable doctors to consult all the them on demand, write health report, medical prescriptions and advises, and also with an integration that allow doctors to publish health article so that users of that system would view and comments, post health tips, and also enable patients to ask questions tends to be very efficient due to the fact that less time is spent on the service since it is automated; giving accurate and reliable access in a lesser time. The need of a computerized information system cannot be overemphasized with the present trend in technological development

This project covers a responsive and progressive android-based app that allows doctors to consult patient with a real-time chat that pushes notifications to both doctor and patient to demand their attention with regard to health issues, allow doctors to send health report to the patients, allow asking public questions by the patient and having them answered by the doctors, allow doctors to share health tips and article to all the application users, viewing and updating of profiles etc.
For the limitation, the project is faced with quite a few restrictions such as the system will only cover above mention features.
